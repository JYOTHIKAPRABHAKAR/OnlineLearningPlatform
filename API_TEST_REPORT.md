# Online Learning Platform API Test Report

## 🎯 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Test Date**: June 24, 2025  
**Total APIs Tested**: 41  
**Passing**: 11 (26.83%)  
**Failing**: 30 (73.17%)  
**Server Status**: ✅ Running on port 3000  
**Database**: ✅ Connected and seeded  

## ✅ **WORKING FEATURES**

### 1. **Core Infrastructure**
- ✅ Server startup and health check
- ✅ Database connection and seeding
- ✅ Authentication middleware
- ✅ JWT token generation and validation
- ✅ Basic error handling

### 2. **Authentication System**
- ✅ User registration (with validation)
- ✅ Educator registration
- ✅ User login with seeded data
- ✅ Password hashing and verification
- ✅ Role-based access control

### 3. **Course Management**
- ✅ Browse all courses

- ✅ Start tests (with authentication)

## ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX**

### 1. **Missing Route Implementations**
- `/api/progress/dashboard` - Learning dashboard
- `/api/subscriptions/purchase` - Subscription purchase
- `/api/search` - Global search functionality

### 2. **Database Schema Issues**
- `doubts` table missing (should be `doubt_sessions`)
- `reviews` table missing (should be `course_reviews`)
- `subscriptions` table structure mismatch

### 3. **Authentication Requirements**
- Many endpoints require authentication but are being called without tokens
- Need to implement proper token flow in tests

### 4. **Validation Issues**
- Phone number validation needs adjustment
- Some query parameter validations are too strict

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED**

### 1. **Fix Database Schema**
```sql
-- Add missing tables or rename existing ones
-- Ensure all foreign key relationships are correct
```

### 2. **Implement Missing Routes**
- Progress dashboard
- Subscription purchase
- Global search
- Live class management

### 3. **Update Test Script**
- Add proper authentication flow
- Fix endpoint paths
- Add proper error handling
